# BadCommits
For work reasons I had to regain some confidence in C++, I thought that the best way to do it was to combine business with pleasure, hence BadCommits was born. 
A big problem afflicts our society, commits written without the slightest sense, what BadCommits does is simply; given an svn path, it lists the users with the highest number of meaningless commits. In its simplicity it allows you to resume the basics of data manipulation in C++ and makes you have a laugh with your colleagues.😁
